# Phase 2 Implementation Complete

## Summary

All Phase 2 NIPs have been successfully implemented for CoreNostr.

## Completed NIPs

### Priority 1 (Completed)
- **NIP-19**: Bech32-encoded entities (npub, nsec, note, nprofile, nevent, nrelay, naddr)
  - Full bech32 encoding/decoding with TLV support
  - Complete test coverage

- **NIP-10**: Reply Threading  
  - Tag reference parsing for both marked and positional formats
  - Helper methods for creating reply events
  - Thread analysis utilities

- **NIP-21**: nostr: URI scheme
  - String-based URI parsing (no URL dependencies)
  - Support for all entity types

### Priority 2 (Completed)
- **NIP-11**: Relay Information Document
  - Complete data models with Codable support
  - Snake_case JSON field mapping
  - All relay metadata fields supported

- **NIP-09**: Event Deletion
  - Deletion event creation helpers
  - Deletion tracking and verification
  - Added EventKind.deletion case

### Priority 3 (Completed)
- **NIP-13**: Proof of Work
  - Mining algorithm with configurable parameters
  - Difficulty calculation and verification
  - Async/await support with cancellation
  - Progress tracking and timeout support
  - Comprehensive test suite

## Architecture Notes

All implementations follow the CoreNostr architecture principles:
- Pure Swift code with no platform dependencies
- No networking code (data models and algorithms only)
- Full Sendable conformance for concurrency safety
- Comprehensive test coverage using Swift Testing framework

## Next Steps

Phase 2 is now complete. Ready for Phase 3 planning or any other tasks.
